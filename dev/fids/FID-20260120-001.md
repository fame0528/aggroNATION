## 📋 Feature Summary

**Title:** AI News Aggregator Homepage Scaffold

**Description:**
Create a modern, clean homepage design for Aggronation - an AI news aggregator. This initial phase focuses on the visual structure and layout without data integration. Build a responsive, card-based interface optimized for displaying news articles from multiple sources (RSS, Reddit, YouTube, X posts).

## 🏗️ Implementation Approach

**Strategy:**
Phase 1 scaffold focusing on UI/UX structure before data layer complexity. Build modular components for easy iteration and extension.

**Technical Details:**
1. Create TypeScript interfaces for article data structure
2. Build mock data with varied sources (RSS, Reddit, YouTube, X)
3. Create reusable HeroUI-based components
4. Implement responsive grid layout
5. Add hero section with branding
6. Integrate filter/sort UI (non-functional initially)

**Design Philosophy:**
- Clean, content-first design inspired by Hacker News meets modern Twitter
- Card layout with emphasis on readability
- Quick scanning with visual hierarchy
- Performance-first (no heavy images initially)
